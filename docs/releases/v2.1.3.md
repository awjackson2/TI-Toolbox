# Release v2.1.3

**Release Date**: October 08, 2025

#### Additions
- - **Executable Launcher**: pre-flight check for existing containers to avoid start conflicts.
- - **Executable Launcher**: validation of path input (for mannual inputs)
- - **Flex-search**: dynamic focality thresholding for better output
- - **Development**: Added a watchdog for easier GUI development
- - **Analyzer**: Added `labeling.nii.gz` as an option for voxel analysis w/o need for recon-all

#### Fixes
- - **General**: Removed env limits for flex-search, cleaned up GUI tabs, fixed Gmsh GUI lauchner with analysis visuals, fixed example data (ernie, MNI152) mounting in executable mode, clean up of executable console output.
- - **Critical**: Batch processing of sub-cortical targets in flex-search mode. Previous, `labeling.nii.gz` was no updating between subjects, causing incorrect optimization targeting.
